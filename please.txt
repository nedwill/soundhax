I know that was a clickbait, but please :'(
Understand me, a O3DS-E user, that is waiting for a free primary hax, i was really happy while watching 33c3 "Nintendo Hacking 2016" 
but here i'm disappointed, like really, it have only N3DS USA support :/

Can you please add :

- Old 3DS / Nintendo 2DS support
- EUR/JPN support

If you want i can help, but i haven't a dev 3DS so :/

I'd be glad if you add OLD 3DS and EUR support by yourself, like it would be amazing ! :)

gratz,

      NexoCube (or Brick, as u want)
